## Who am I

Hello lovely people🤩🤗  

I am Marion  - Community Manager at Weaviate, tech innovation enthusiast, and lover of fantasy books! I am a highly positive personality with a great sense of humor and a strong human centered and growth minded approach on everything.

## What I love doing

💞 I love uniting people and tech in order to tackle everyday challenges, grow innovation and drive change for a sustainable future with the help of technology.

So I am getting very excited when people (especially developers) come together to build the next big thing, be creative and help each other be their most successful self and the best version of themself.

## My current position

🥑 As Community Manager and part of the Developer Relations Team I bring the vision and strategy around all things community here at Weaviate to life!

***I will make our community a great and safe place where people can learn, make friends and grow their careers. A place for giving and receiving and ultimately develop and share practices that help individuals in the group thrive.*** 

My strong proven skills in community management, DevRel strategy, GTM strategies, relationship building, value driven methodologies and  business development & operations paired with Also a deep understanding of technologies around hybrid cloud, data and AI help me every day to drive innovation and embrace teamwork, diversity, culture and inclusion. 

So let’s team up and foster innovation and building great applications around vector search, data and AI by using Weaviate.

## My past endeavors

🌱 I possess a demonstrated history of working in IT, development, services and customer oriented organizations. Before joining Weaviate I have been working for IBM, Aiven and Code Intelligence in different positions and organizations and gained profound experience in the area of Developer and Partner Relations with a very good technical understanding and a Diploma focused in Applied Computer Science from University for Cooperate Education (BA). 

During High School I had the great chance to live on year in the States as an exchange student. This was the start of my love for people, diversity and inclusion and a strong foundation for working in a US centric company for more than a decade ;)

During my childhood I lived in and around Berlin (Yes I am an “Ossie”), before I moved to South Germany for roughly 10 years. 

I am now back to my origins and live near to Berlin.🫶

## There is so much more

🚀 When not working I am a mother of 2 lovely kids (a girl and a boy). I totally enjoy reading Manga's and fantasy books and eating great food - and even better with good friends and/or family gathering.
I am also trying to keep my body and brain fit by going to fitness classes - definitely every Wednesday and also trying on Mondays but weellll you know life 🤭.
During the Winter season I love riding fresh powder lines on my banana smoothie snowboard🏂
